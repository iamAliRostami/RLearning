How to defend against viruses<<-->>1) Limit the exchange of .EXE, .COM, .OVR, .OVL, .SYS, .DOC, .XLS and system files (.SYS) between computers on the network and avoid using network servers as working environments .
2) Reduce the use of shareware and public domain programs if their origin is unknown.
3) Do not insert your "system disk" in another computer if not in "write protection" condition and never add data or files to floppies containing original programs.
