What are they and how do they spread?<<-->>A computer virus is similar to a biological virus: it is a program designed and built to cause damage within the infected device. The first viruses were born with modern informatics (1980) and over the decades have evolved to better adapt to a constantly changing environment. From the point of view of their lifecycle, after the "reproductive" phase, computer viruses begin to carry out activities of various kinds: destructive and/or obstructive. How do they spread? By transferring infected files from one computer to another, and, even more seriously, they can attack computers connected to each other on the network.
