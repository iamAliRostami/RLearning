Advantages and disadvantages<<-->>In addition to greater IT security and the protection of personal data, the VPN allows the circumvention of geographical barriers. In fact, virtually all VPN services provide servers in many countries. With the VPN you can watch a video on the BBC website, choosing a server in the UK, without the content being blocked. The same applies to a site in the United States, or in France, or Germany.
A disadvantage of surfing the net through the VPN is the limited bandwidth available and a certain slowness in connecting to web pages. Slowness due to the fact that the activity of coding and decrypting of encrypted data takes time.
