First generation and recent viruses<<-->>While first generation viruses only attacked executable files (which are recognizable in the DOS operating system because they have a .COM or .EXE extension), current viruses are able to infect many other types of files and change the instructions of the BIOS loaded into RAM, to spread through the same physical media contained in the PC and even damage the hardware.
Finally, some new types of viruses have appeared: the so-called macro viruses that stick to document files generated for example with Microsoft Word for Windows, Microsoft Excel etc.
