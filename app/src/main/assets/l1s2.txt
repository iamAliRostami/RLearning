Guidelines<<-->>First, choose a fairly long password (composed of at least 15-20 characters) alternating letters, both uppercase and lowercase, numbers, punctuation marks and symbols (e.g. !,?,Â£,$,#,% etc.). In fact, by using a sequence of characters that does not make up a meaningful word or phrase, you will discourage attempts by attackers who make attacks based on dictionaries. Such attacks are based on searching for your password in very long common word lists, or a dictionary.
 Another very important precaution is to not use words as passwords that can somehow be guessed by other people. To go a little further, do not use names of your family members, your date of birth or wedding anniversary or other data that is easily traceable to you.
 It is also a good idea to constantly update your passwords (possibly at least once every 2-3 months), since no password is 100% secure. Another aspect not to be overlooked is that of using different passwords for each account: if you do that, even if they should unfortunately intercept one of your access keys, the security of other accounts would not be compromised.
