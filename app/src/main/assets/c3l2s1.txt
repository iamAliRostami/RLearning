What is it and how does it work?<<-->>The VPN, created for companies but now also used by private individuals to increase Internet security, creates a virtual tunnel between our computer and a secure server owned by the VPN service provider. All traffic is encrypted from the computer to the server, and then exits "normally" on the Internet. In summary, this allows you to surf privately and securely even in public Wi-Fi networks. Thanks to the VPN, Internet browsing will come from an anonymous data center instead of the IP address registered to John Smith.
