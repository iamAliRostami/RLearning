To whom does it apply?<<-->>The impact is wider than you might think: the GDPR concerns in fact all companies that handle any type of personal data: from information on its employees to customer profiling on behalf of third parties, or even analyzing data for marketing activities.
Companies that do not comply with this regulation can incur penalties of up to 20 million euros, or, in the case of larger companies, up to 4% of turnover.
