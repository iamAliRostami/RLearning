Creating a secure password<<-->>After having seen some general advice on how to choose a sufficiently secure password, the time has come to move from theory to practice. In fact, there are several useful tools to choose a secure password. These are basically automatic password generators that, complying with the guidelines of the previous chapter, create quite secure access keys.
 One of the most famous password generators is Password Chart. As the name of this service indicates, it allows the creation of access keys using transcoding technique. How does this work? In practice, the user types a sentence that allows you to generate the scheme that will be used to create the password, then types the word that will be used as a reference for creating the password and, at that point, the software will associate with each letter of the alphabet a specific combination of numbers, letters and symbols, thus creating a fairly secure password.
